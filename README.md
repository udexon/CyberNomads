# Cybernomads 太虚游民

> A Charity-cum-Business venture to provide training in videography, promotion of properties business and other skills

Homelessness has become a critical problem ever since the dawn of industrialization and the urbanization that came along.

**_Cybernomads_** is an initiative to make use of vacant real estate worldwide as training ground for people of all ages and all walks of life, including the homeless, so that they can be upgraded and become financially independent.

We choose the name Cybernomads because one of our main "propaganda" weapon is to make videos to promote high end real estates on social media, while our participants move from one vacant property to another.
